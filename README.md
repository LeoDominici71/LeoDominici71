## About me

✨ I'm a backend engineer with a 🎓 degree in Economics and a 📘 postgraduate specialization in Java and Software Architecture.
🏦 I’ve gained a deep understanding of banking systems after several years working in the financial market — from customer service, through insurance, all the way to investments.

📚 I love reading about economics, and I’m a big enthusiast of DeFi and blockchain.
🛠️ Also, I'm a certified blockchain developer by the Blockchain Council.
